# NXP-car-project

This project was completed in spring 2021 through the course Interface and Digitial Electronics at RIT. With my partner, Shery Mathews, we interfaced with different sensors, motors, K64F microcontroller, and others to build, program, and develop an autonomous car. Various techniques were used to ensure the car could drive on a track that was subject to change featuring straightaways, intersections, and sharp turns. These techniques included PID control, braking, variable speed, and optimization of processing line scan data. The competition detailed 13 other teams including students, teaching assistants, and our professor, Louis Beato. We were able to place 6th place.
